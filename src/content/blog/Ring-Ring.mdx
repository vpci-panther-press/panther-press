  hours, she’s always giving but gets nothing in return.

<Centered>
  Ring Ring

Dread lingers as I make my way to work

Ring Ring

Dawning the noticeable red vest

Ring Ring

Bell in my hands, shaking it to the same tunes

Ring Ring

I’ve played Last Christmas more than Wham!

Ring Ring

Humming jingle bells while my mind rots slowly

Ring Ring

Hours pass by

Ring Ring

Observing the public

Ring Ring

Donations flood through

Ring Ring

Not a single penny in my pocket

Ring Ring

Face numbing, smiling for the hundredth time

Ring Ring

Frigid air nipping at my fingers

Ring Ring

The creak of the door prominent all day

Ring Ring

Cacophony of voices lingers in the entrance

Ring Ring

Small talk with weird strangers

Ring Ring

Laughing with their weird jokes

Ring Ring

I can’t wait for christmas to end

Ring Ring

So I just have to stand there

Ring Ring

Ringing my bell

Ring Ring
