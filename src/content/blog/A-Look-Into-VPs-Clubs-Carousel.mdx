# Discovering Diverse Horizons

On November 9th, the Student Leadership Council hosted Victoria Park’s club carousel. The event was hosted in the cafeteria during lunch, with the goal of making clubs more accessible to the student body as the pandemic had greatly complicated the process of creating and maintaining clubs. The carousel offered an overview of all of VPCI’s clubs by establishing existing and newly created clubs and displaying information on a club bulletin board outside Gym 1.

## Student Leadership Council and School Community

The stands for the Student Leadership Council and VP ambassadors were placed at the front of the cafeteria. These councils play an integral role in representing the school community by creating events that spur VP spirit along with bringing the student body together. Across from them were the stands of Yearbook Club and Panther Press. Both these clubs capture memorable school events and recount school adventures through a yearbook that can be bought at the end of the year and a newspaper published monthly featuring student writers.

## Student Associations

Towards the right were student associations including: Black Student Association, Middle Eastern North African Association, Muslim Student Association, Tamil Association, Pride VP, and She Empowers. These clubs all have one common mission: to eliminate an existing inequality in our society and bring minorities together. These clubs are a great way to join a community that you can truly belong to and contribute to create a welcoming environment for everyone.

## The Arts

VP’s art and linguistic clubs include Literature Club, French Club, and Mandarin Club. These clubs aim to improve literacy and create opportunities for students to learn new languages and explore new cultures. Clubs alongside these were Film Crew, Dance Club, Chess Club, and Gardening Club. All of these clubs ultimately unleash student creativity and are a means to do what you love most whether it be writing by a warm ambient fire, creating a new batch of compost, or aceing a brand new dance move.

## Student Councils

At the end of the cafeteria were all the student councils. Starting from the Athletics Council, it also included the Mental Health Awareness Council, Arts Council, Music Council, and Eco Council. They provided information about the role that each council plays in the school community, with interactive displays like the Music Council having instruments that participants could play.

## STEM

Down the left were the stands of all the STEM clubs. These included Gaming Club, Coding Club, Math Club, Science Club, Science Olympics, Lab Management Team, and Robotics. These stands all had cardboard displays, with many of them including computers and machines for onlookers to interact with. Across from them were clubs focused on medicine, such as Ditsy, HOSA and Medlife and business-related clubs, such as World Vision, MUN, and FBLA.

## Conclusion

Although clubs are plentiful at any school, their importance should not be understated. Brooke, the clubs representative for SLC has shared that “\[c]lubs create a backbone for the school community, by bringing people together through shared interests”. If none of the mentioned clubs caught your interest, there is always the possibility to start your own.
