VPCI’s Book fair is an annual event hosted by Oxfam and the literature club. During this event, students are able to donate and purchase books from each other! The book fair is a great way to find new and interesting reads, while also donating your old, unread books.\\

How to participate?

This year, VPCI’s book fair was held at the library! It was open for the last 20 minutes of lunch and students came to buy or donate books! There were books on shelves that you could look through and if you saw a book that you found interesting, you could purchase it for just a dollar! \\

Well now that you know about our book fair, you may be wondering what makes it so interesting? VP’s Book fair is great, namely for the cheapness of its books! Although the book fair’s selection may not be large, for a quick read, it’s a great place to check out! You can also guarantee that the proceeds are going to a good cause and can even benefit your school life. The book fair also helps reduce the amount of paper waste that is caused by throwing out old books! \\

What’s the purpose of VPCI’s Book fair?

In the world, many people do not have access to a proper education. Many different people, due to various reasons, cannot read, write or learn like the rest of us. 

This may include women, who in certain countries, are expected to cook and clean for the family. Many schools in these countries are also unable to provide a safe and sanitary place for girls to learn. 

Some people also have financial issues. Not everyone is fortunate enough to be born into a financially stable family, and  there are many people in the world who do not have access to education the way we do. Oxfam and VP want to change that. Every year we hold the book fair to raise awareness about the less fortunate. 

Overall, VPCI’s book fair is just one of the many fantastic events that are hosted throughout the school year.
