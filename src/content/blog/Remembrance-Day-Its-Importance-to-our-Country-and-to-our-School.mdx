# The Importance of Rememberance Day

From August 1914 to November 1918, the world was locked in a devastating bloodbath of war. For Canada, the war brought important change to its social, political, and economic sectors, and shaped the Canada we know today.

&#x9;As World War I stretched on, the desperate need for munition and equipment pushed more and more factories to be built. Canada’s economy underwent rapid industrialization-- the Imperial Munitions Board, founded in November 1915 with financial magnate Joseph Flavelle in command, soon had more than 600 factories churning out vast quantities of artillery shells, fuses and explosives, and building aircraft and naval vessels. As demand for ammunition soared and more and more men left to participate in the war, women working in factories-- something seen as a “man’s job”-- grew exponentially. By 1920, the percentage of women in the workforce had increased to 21%, and a gradual shift was beginning to take place. Instead of being ostracized from work, women began to be encouraged to seek employment in factories. It was an important milestone in the fight for women’s rights: while there was still a clear pay inequality between men and women, the acknowledgment of their importance in the war, as well as their opportunity to be independent, brought great change to the future of gender equality.

&#x9;Undoubtedly, World War I brought devastating grief to the families, friends, and loved ones of those lost. Tens of millions of lives were lost, and even more were shattered forever. However, as we mourn those who have died, it is also important to acknowledge the war’s role in Canada’s growth and development as a country.

# Victoria Park Commemorates Remembrance Day

Across Victoria Park, students, teachers, and staff have all commemorated Remembrance Day in many ways.

On the day before Remembrance Day, students stood in silence to commemorate the lives of Canadian soldiers lost during the war as ceremony music was played in honour. Many teachers also presented slideshows that showed facts related to remembrance day, such as famous soldiers who were remembered and the role minorities played during the war.

On the glass board at the front foyer, pictures of soldiers who died were shown, as well as pictures of ceremonies related to Remembrance Day. Along with them were posters and history textbooks that showed poems and information about previous wars. Artwork of coloured poppies was displayed as well.

Many students believe that Remembrance Day is important not only for the past, but also for the present. A student who asked to remain anonymous stated “Remembrance Day isn’t just about remembering people who died in previous wars; it’s about coming together as a community to honour the lost lives of those who allowed us to stay where we are.”
