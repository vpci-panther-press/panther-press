## Introduction

The days are long, and the nights are filled with open textbooks and furious notetaking. That’s right, it’s exam season. After just completing all their culminating projects, students are thrown into another week of cramming for final exams. With some exams being worth almost 30% of your final mark, one feeling is common among students: stress.

## End of Semester

With the way that our semesters are set up, demanding and laboured days at the end of January are unavoidable. Not only do you have culminating projects for nearly every course, but some of them also include a final exam. All of these important assessments and assignments that are due in rapid succession can be difficult for most students to handle. The results from this increased workload include varying degrees of panic, anxiety, and distress.

## Handling Stress

So, what can students do to handle their stress in healthy ways? Well, the first thing you should do if you’re distressed about the “what ifs” is to remind yourself that a bad mark isn't the end of the world. Even though grades are important, it isn’t healthy nor productive to beat yourself up over a less-than-satisfactory mark. Be sure to set realistic expectations for yourself because having unattainable goals can significantly contribute to your stress. If you’re feeling overwhelmed by everything going on, take a step back and just breathe. Having short breaks between your study sessions will not only help you destress, but also refresh your mind when you’re reviewing course material.

## Studying Tips

If you’re able to manage your stress but still feel unprepared for your exams, try changing the way you study to be more effective. Instead of going through everything at once, break the content down into smaller chunks to make it more digestible. Additionally, creating a schedule for your studying can help improve your time management and help you stay on track. Remember to prioritize your tasks based on the importance and difficulty of the subject. If you have any trouble with the work, don’t be afraid to ask your teacher for help. It may not seem like it, but they want to see their students succeed just as much as you. Using resources such as textbooks, online materials, and even your peers can benefit you greatly while studying.

## Conclusion

At the end of the day, exam stress is something every student goes through, and everyone handles it differently. Remember that taking care of your mental health is just as important as being academically prepared. Sometimes, it’s not about the destination, but rather the friends we made along the way. Good luck!
