# The Spirit of Halloween Summons VP

By: Zahraa Jahangir, Mariam Hussain

Halloween always marks festive fall colours mixed with warm pumpkin spices, outrageous costumes, and stealing your siblings’ trick-or-treat loot. Although VP didn’t take its students to a trick-or-treating fiesta, it did host many activities to bring those eerie vibes. VP celebrated Halloween in its own way with SLC and Oxfam having organized a series of unforgettable activities.

To spur the VP spirit, SLC organized two weeks of spirit day fun:

## Movie Monday

Students were decked out in their coziest pajamas to start off Hallo-week. Some students even brought their stuffy friends to make pajama day a real deal. After school, SLC hosted movie night by playing Coraline. It was a great turnout with laughter and the smell of popcorn wafting through the air!

## Haunted SLC Office (Tuesday)

The hallways were filled with scarlet and gold as students wore school colours for Day 2 of the Hallo-week. Throughout the day, people of the student body showed off their VP spirit through the school merch.  During lunch, students were put to the test to see if they could escape the Haunted SLC Office.

## Pumpkin Painting Contest (Wednesday)

To start off Day 3 of the Hallo-week, students put an effort to rizz each other up by dressing as their type! During lunch, students came together in the courtyard in groups of four to paint their spooky unique pumpkins for the Pumpkin Painting Contest. Pumpkin pictures were posted on Instagram and the one with the most likes will win. Keep a lookout in the announcements for the winner!

## Halloween Dance (Friday)

The halloween dance was absolutely brilliant with many events keeping the students entertained. Forget teepeeing houses, students tpeed each other to create modern mummies. A grand musical chair competition became very intense with a final showdown leading to the ultimate winner. Students also danced their hearts out wearing glow in the dark bracelets and singing to their favorite tunes. Whether you were thrown around by the crowd, or tired your legs from jump roping, the Halloween dance was a big hit for all.

## Fashion Show (Tuesday)

For the last day of Hallo-week, face-painting sessions and a fashion show were prepared to show off the unique and sophisticated costumes worn by VP students! The day was filled with vibrant colours and art as students dressed according to the final spirit week theme which was to wear their Halloween costumes/cosplays.

During lunch each day, SLC and MEDLIFE hosted a Halloween Bingo! Students played every day for the chance to win a goody bag or a $15 gift card. Additionally, students could participate in the spirit days to be entered into a draw for a daily prize!

The spirit week hosted by SLC and Oxfam was a great success in bringing in the Halloween spirit at VP! Students prepared to show off their VP spirit through the Spirit Week themes for each day (from October 23 to October 30) and by participating in activities hosted for each day (pumpkin painting contest, fashion show, etc). For Halloween, SLC and Oxfam delivered a spectacular, outstanding and thrilling Hallo-week full of treats and no tricks!
