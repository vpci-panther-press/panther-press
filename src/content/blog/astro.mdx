title: Cats vs. Dogs
---

There are several debates that divide people into different sides. Does pineapple belong on pizza? Is the hotdog a sandwich? Cereal first or milk first? …However, there is one debate that can turn enemies into friends and friends into enemies: cats vs. dogs. People have different arguments that support their preferred side, but one thing is clear—dogs are superior companions than cats. They outshine cats on every single criterion of being a good pet: loyalty, protection, playfulness, versatility and positivity.

There is a reason dogs are a person’s best friend, as their loyalty and companionship is unmatched. Your dog will always be happy when they are around you, they cherish every interaction they share with you and are ready to protect you. If you come home late at night or after being gone for a while, they will be super excited to greet you. Dogs shower you with kisses and cuddles, comforting and supporting, unlike cats, who would care less if you were home as long as they are fed and watered.

Coming back to the idea of loyalty, dogs are the very best form of guardians. Canines have been bred by humans for centuries to help protect their communities and livestock. Dogs have protective instincts, allowing them to sniff out any form of danger posed on their owner, keeping your peace of mind. Even if someone or something tried to harm you, your dog would jump in and help you fight off the preparator. A cat, on the other hand, would much prefer you being the main target so they can run away and find safety.

Dogs are also superior companions as there is a dog breed for everybody. If you live a highly active lifestyle and spend lots of time outdoors, dog breeds such as a Labrador Retriever or German Shepard might be a good fit for you. If you prefer to stay at home and spend time indoors, breeds such as Pugs and Chihuahuas will suit you better. If you are in the middle and enjoy spending some time indoors and sometime outdoors, a breed like the Golden retriever can be your best friend. Dogs are also easier to travel with, as they can adapt to new surroundings and people. Cats, on the other hand, are suitable for people who prefer to spend their time indoors. They are extremely sensitive, and even the most basic hindrance can damage a cat’s health. Dogs are more well-rounded and better for people with an ever changing lifestyle.

The main reason I believe dogs are better than cats is the fact that dogs spread more positivity and have a larger impact on the population. Dogs are better at showing and expressing their emotions towards their owners. They wag their tails and shower you with kisses and cuddles whenever you are around them. They are also extremely loyal and protective, helping you in the face of any kind of danger. Dogs are also extremely intelligent and can follow commands better than most people. The three traits above make dogs the perfect candidate for service animals, with over 390,000 dogs in service in Canada alone; the task of these dogs can range from detecting spikes in blood sugar levels to providing emotional support.

While both dogs and cats have their own charming characteristics, dogs are the clear winners over cats in terms of being the better pet. All of their qualities, from their ability to protect you when in danger, to being able to sit with you on the couch while watching a movie, make them the ideal companion for everyone.
