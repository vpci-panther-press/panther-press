| **what does tori stand for ? Is this in anyway related to S. Torrie of science department**                                                                       | Dear Viewer, tori does not stand for anything, in fact I have no opinions, but an abbreviation of victoria park! Pretty cool if you ask me, which means we are not associated with Ms. Torrie in any way!                                                                                                                                   |

We are only on this earth for a short time, why not try to get what you want? Carpe Diem! |
