Over the past few weeks, the weather has cooled and the days have shortened. With this swift change comes the transition between the fall and winter sports seasons. Though the fields are empty and frosted over, the sporting landscape is as vibrant as ever within VPCI’s indoor athletic facilities. Join us as we celebrate the achievements of our fall teams and welcome a new roster of sports squads.

## FALL RECALL

Over the past month, the fall teams have been busy wrapping up their seasons. They have accumulated numerous successes while competing in tournaments around both the city and province.

The girls’ basketball team finished up their season with a series of games against their opponents in the North Region. After a 38-25 loss against Don Mills CI and a game that ended 42-32 in favour of Newtonbrook SS, the girls left everything on the court in their final game against George S Henry, ending with a thrilling 45-40 victory.

On the race course, the school's cross country team witnessed a remarkable achievement as the Grade 9 boys secured a coveted spot at OFSAA. Their journey was a testament to their dedication and grit. At the provincial competition in Etobicoke, the novice boys clocked an impressive average team time of 15 minutes and 34 seconds for the four-kilometre run. Notably, one VPCI runner placed 51st among 250+ contestants.

The boys’ volleyball team rematched against each school in their division, winning 2-1 and 2-0 against George Vanier and George S Henry, respectively. They also suffered a 2-0 loss to AY Jackson. This kept them at second place in the STO Conference East Division, qualifying them for regional quarterfinals. After a 2-1 victory over John Polanyi, the West Division champion, they proceeded to regional semifinals. The boys’ season ended with a 3-0 loss to William Lyon Mackenzie in a best 3 out of 5 semifinal round.

The boys’ soccer squad concluded their season with a 3-0 victory against Westview Centennial and a 2-0 loss to Emery CI. Overall, the season yielded three wins, two losses, and one tie, tying Victoria Park for third place in the North Region.

Finally, the girls’ rugby team ended their season at city finals. Although they were seeded eighth following the regular season, they put up a remarkable performance against Malvern CI, the first seed. This matchup ended in a loss, so the girls tried for redemption in the loser’s bracket. After a victorious second game, they went on to play George S Henry to battle for fifth place. George S ultimately came out triumphant; nevertheless, it was a memorable day for the Victoria Park Panthers.

## CURRENT AFFAIRS

VPCI’s winter sports teams have not started competing yet, but in the meantime, plenty of spectacular sporting events are taking place within the school. After a mini “World Cup” organized by VP MENAA, which resulted in a victory for Türkiye, VPAC hosted its annual three-point shooting contest. This comes right before the start of 3v3 basketball intramurals.

Meanwhile, teams such as indoor cricket, swim, badminton, girls’ volleyball, and boys’ basketball are currently in training. Over the next few weeks, these teams will be heading out to competitions to represent VPCI. Best of luck to all athletes!

Go Panthers!
