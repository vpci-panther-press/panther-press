<Centered>
  She never seemed to be quite in the moment with you when she talked

She was always somewhere else; far away in a distant world

Only talking at moments when our two worlds collided

Her dreams leaked into the day

Yet sunlight never reached her

For she always had a moon above her head and stars in her eyes

{' '}

<br />

Perhaps in that realm, she could place the planets on a string

And tie it on her wrist

Maybe she could wear the Sun around her neck

Just to let others bask in its gleam

Perhaps she wanted to hold every ocean in her palm

Or let the birds nest in her hair

Maybe what she wanted most, was to break the dam

And let it flow away with the river

To some far off horizon her eyes could never see

{' '}

<br />

In her kingdom, she is whole and cast in colour

While in ours, a mere portrait

Displayed in black and white

And although her body is tied to these grounds by logic and reason

Imagination pulls her away

To endless possibilities forever twinkling with an otherworldly sparkle in her eyes

{' '}

<br />

And although she appears to be sinking in sleep

She has never been more awake

Listening to the echoes of both worlds

And talking

At moments when they collide

</Centered>
