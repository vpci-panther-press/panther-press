When it comes to clubs, VP has plenty of options suitable for everyone. This month’s club highlight was focused on the in-person British Parliamentary debate on October 23, hosted by our very own VP Debate club! \


So, why the in person debate, you may ask? Well, we’ve got the answer, straight from the source! Debate co-president Sarah Wang says, “with Halloween right around the corner, we were hoping to improve the spirit with a celebration with more community engagement! Especially with virtual meetings, we felt that this would be a great way for debaters to interact with one another.” 



Now for the actual debate! This meeting’s focus was on the motion: This House Would tackle the kid.



Confused? Don’t worry, so were we. The infoslide (background information as necessary for the debate) reads as follows:

You are the strong safety for the Cleveland Browns, the worst team in the history of football. You have played for them for your entire 15 year career and have decided at the beginning of the year that regardless of the results, you would retire at the end of the year. You were born and raised in Cleveland and are the pride of the city. There are 3 religious institutions named after you, a Church, Synagogue, and a Mosque and 4 schools named after you. You are the reason LeBron came back. YOU ARE CLEVELAND. That cannot be understated in this debate. Somehow you've carried the team to the Superbowl, the most important game of the year, and it's the last play of the game and you're up by 5 (a touchdown is worth 6) the opposing team has the ball and substitutes on a 6 year old boy with leukemia at running back whose make-a-wish dream is to score a touchdown in the NFL. The play begins and the kid has the ball, everyone has let him through. You're the last line of defense . \

It was a very insightful and exciting debate, and every team gave their best effort. The main arguments on the Proposition side were regarding the integrity of football and the loyalty and respect to Cleveland citizens, whilst the Opposition debaters came up with very convincing arguments on personal and moral fulfillment, as well as discussing the topic of how winning isn’t always that important. In the end, there were no winners, because according to debate co-president Alisa Chen, “everyone’s a winner!” 



Overall, the event was very successful and engaging, even including prizes such as a VP Debate water bottle raffle, candy (for Halloween), and stickers! Spectators and debaters alike enjoyed the experience. It was a very exciting event here at VP, and we can’t wait for next month’s club highlight!
