Note: The catastrophe in Palestine and Lebanon is unfolding as the world watches the atrocities committed by Israel being streamed live on social media and reported by independent news channels. This article is to shed light on what should be the headlines every day on every news channel, but is not. All numbers in this article are accurate as of October 24, 2024.

## The Gaza Strip of Palestine

\&emsp; At least 43,362 people, including nearly 16,765 children, have been killed by Israeli air strikes since October 7th 2023 in Gaza, Palestine. More than 99,795 people were injured and more than 10,000 are missing under the rubble. \[1] 

\&emsp; “Overall, about 96% of the population faced high levels of acute food insecurity,” an article from Reuters says. \[2] Israel allows almost no aid or supplies to enter the Gaza strip. 

\&emsp; There are no operating schools in Gaza because many are in ruins, and the ones still standing are being used as shelters. 

\&emsp; There have been more than 370 attacks on health care in Gaza since the 7th of  October.\[3]

\&emsp; Israel is using highly toxic white phosphorus bombs to create more damage and poison Gaza’s underground water reserves. White phosphorus is considered internationally illegal to use on civilians - which is exactly what Israel is doing.\[4]

\&emsp; These people are innocent, but are still occupied. Every day kids in the region encounter experiences more traumatic than the day before. 

## The West Bank of Palestine

\&emsp; At least 759 people, including at least 165 children, have been killed by Israel, and more than 6,250 people injured in the west bank of Palestine. Israeli soldiers are consistently raiding the West Bank, arresting civilians. \[1]

\&emsp; Civilians living in the West Bank of Palestine are being kicked out of their homes as settlers move in. 

\&emsp; Israel constantly raids the west bank, shooting people and showing no mercy. The raids end in Israeli soldiers throwing the bodies of their victims from roof tops. 

## Lebanon

\&emsp; At least 2,600 people in Lebanon have been killed by Israeli missiles, and almost 10,000 wounded  just since the beginning of Israel's strikes.\[5] Every day, the children of Lebanon and Palestine, wake up not knowing whether today will be the day they are dug up from the rubble to be put with the sky-high piles of the bodies of martyrs.

\&emsp; Kids are not going to school anymore for fear of getting bombed. In these buildings, those who have lost their homes stay.

\&emsp; Hospitals are in ruins and ambulances are being bombed. 

\&emsp; Here too, Israel is burning the cities and towns with white phosphorus bombs, terrorizing the country. 

## The War Enabler

\&emsp; The United States has given Israel a minimum of 20 billion dollars in weapons and military supplements since October 2023 \[6]\[7], including fighter jets and missiles, to be used to end innocent lives in the Middle East. 

\


\&emsp; This is not a war. It is a genocide, it is ethnic cleansing.
