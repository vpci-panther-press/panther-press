The sight of bustling students and bags lined against the school's brick-and-mortar past the 9:00 AM bell is sure to puzzle any unsuspecting passerby. However, to the students of Victoria Park, this is a longstanding school tradition. 9th graders are given the opportunity to go on a trip to Camp Tamarack, where they can meet new friends and create unforgettable memories. This year was no different. On Monday, September 16th, the new freshmen left with the older counselors, beginning their three-day experience of adventure and excitement. \


Although the students only took off in mid-September, planning for this event took place several months prior. Monica, the Theme Coordinator, said the executive team worked together on budgeting, scheduling, and theme preparations over multiple months in the spring. Their work was guided by a rough blueprint from previous years, which gave them ideas and a direction for this year's Camp Tamarack. \


In addition to the intense workload of planning, executives also encountered other challenges. Ivy, a Co-Director of Camp Tamarack, explained the team faced an unpredictable turnout. This made it difficult to assess the number of counselors they would need, especially when balancing male and female counselors. Despite the uncertainty, they pushed through with the promotion and had a successful attendance. Ivy explained that having confidence in the team played a key role in overcoming obstacles. She shared, “Trusting my \[executive] team to complete every task, trusting the counselors to be fun leaders for the campers, and trusting the planning process” really helped her throughout preparations. 



In the end, their hard work came through. Campers engaged in activities such as rock climbing and a ropes course. They also participated in team-building exercises and made their own tie-dye shirts. For many campers, this was their first experience living away from family, and they bonded over games of Capture the Flag and campfires at night. Of course, no Camp Tamarack is complete without the annual talent show. Like previous years, the event was held on the second evening with all the counselors joining in and performing with the new students. These meticulously planned activities made Camp Tamarack seamlessly enjoyable for the campers, who only had to worry about whether they were first in line for dinner. 



After learning how well-planned the whole experience is, it wasn’t surprising to hear that Camp Tamarack has been running at Victoria Park for over a decade now. Mr. Larratt-Smith, the teacher who started it all, revealed he was inspired by his own experiences with camp in high school. He stated, “I thought the best thing would be for grade 9 students \[...] to have the opportunity to meet other students and to do it in a fun place where there \[wouldn’t be] stressful marks or anything else”. When asked about advice he would give to any incoming freshmen, he answered, “Just... try new things. Try new clubs, try new sports teams, and get to know some of the older students”. While academics are important, what truly makes high school memorable is stepping out of your comfort zone and embracing new experiences.
