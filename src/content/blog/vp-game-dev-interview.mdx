A few weeks ago, our school’s very own Ritvik Goyal created a new club for aspiring and dedicated designers, coders and artists. This club, Game Dev Club, is focused on creating games and utilizes all the aspects that come together to form a successful game such as coding, story writing and music composition, just to name a few. A few days ago, I sat down with Mr. Goyal to talk and ask questions about his new club to really get the inner scoop on some questions potential members may have.

\
Q1: Can you describe what type of members you are looking for? 

“First and foremost, game development requires dedication”, responded Ritvik. To Ritvik, you could be the greatest coder or artist in the world, but you still need the ability to show up to meetings, meet due dates or collaborate with others. 

Q2: What goes into developing a game?

According to Mr. Goyal, game development is done in many steps, with the first step in creating a game being the outline. This involves the story writing element and the theme. Then comes “dialogue, character specifications, and all the details that define the world of your game”. After the groundwork is laid out, artists and programmers can finally get to work, creating the body of the work. Finally, if the game developers are feeling extra saucy, they can get a composer to add music. Once all is completed, the game can be tested and played. \\

Q3: What are going to be the goals this year for your club?

“We aim to train individuals with no prior experience and, by the end of the year, create a few games of our own!”, exclaimed Ritvik. This jolly executive wants to train a small army of game developers who are experienced in the Godot engine, a small army that can eventually work their way up to harder engines like Unity. His ultimate goal is to participate in exhibitions to show off the club’s work and learn from other game developers. \\

After my interview with Ritvik Goyal, it was extremely evident that he is a dedicated and passionate club leader. On behalf of Panther Press, I truly wish him the best of luck on his journey in founding and running a new club at Victoria Park.
