Volunteering presents a tangible way for one to make an impact on communities, and for high school students, school is often the best place to seek volunteer opportunities. These opportunities can range from managing the school landscape to participating in events that channel one’s passion for social change. Today, we are turning the spotlight on VP’s Oxfam and its co-presidents Haodong Wang and Lucas Fang to discover its volunteer opportunities.

Oxfam is a global non-profit organization dedicated to creating lasting solutions to global injustices, with a particular emphasis on improving the well-being of the lives of women and girls. At VP Oxfam, students are given enriching opportunities to spread awareness and run events while gaining volunteer hours and contributing to the school and local community.

**Cora Tian: What volunteer opportunities does Oxfam offer to students? Could you share some of the meaningful activities of the club that club members can participate in or have participated in?**

**Haodong Wang:** Lots of volunteer opportunities. In terms of events, our primary annual event is the food drive. Last year, we donated to Diabetes Canada with 1,500 food items. In terms of awareness, for the past year, we spread awareness about different global issues. We post Instagram posts every now and then, while also hosting interactive activities like Jeopardy to get the school community involved.

**Lucas Fang:** Apart from the food drive, we have multiple other events every year where people can volunteer and contribute in different ways. We’ve done a CoCo’s + Krispy Kreme fundraiser, book fair, hygiene drive - so many meaningful ways to give back to the community. We won’t spoil what’s to come this year, but there’s lots to look forward to!

**CT: Volunteering often brings personal and social benefits. Could you discuss some of the advantages of being an Oxfam member, both in terms of personal growth and community contribution?**

**LF:** Absolutely. In terms of personal benefits, there’s a lot of opportunity for growth. Hands-on experience, understanding the process of organizing an event, improving communication skills, but most importantly developing leadership skills. Community contribution… personally, it's the idea that your efforts and contributions could potentially completely change the course of someone else’s life forever. That feeling is hard to come by.

**HW:** Also, you can earn lots of hours, especially for Grade 9s who are looking for something to do. You can work during lunchtime – in fact, we started our sellings for the Halloween event and there will be people in the front foyer selling during lunch hours. During the actual events, we’ll also have people supervising the events. These count toward your time. So, it’s not just these small 30-minute things, because the hours are substantial. In my opinion, it’s one of the better ways to get volunteer hours.

**CT: Besides Oxfam, what other in-school or out-of-school clubs or organizations would you recommend to students interested in volunteering and making a positive impact?**

**HW:** At Sheppard and Midland, the organization ACSA Community Services has a place for refugees and there are always volunteer options available if you just want to make a general contribution to the community. I used to volunteer at TNG \[The Neighborhood Group]. It’s a good way to gain experience with cooking because you cook for elderly people. If you are interested in gaining personal skills while getting involved in the community, this would be a nice option to check.

**LF:** Also, volunteering at a food bank or at a homeless shelter really opens your eyes to issues people are struggling with, like food, shelter, and other necessities we sometimes take for granted. In terms of the school, SheEmpowers is another club that focuses on women's rights and gives plenty of opportunities to volunteer.

**HW:** And VP Ambassadors. There are a lot of clubs at our school that offer volunteer hours.

At the end of the day, VP Oxfam’s goal is to, as Lucas Fang quotes, “prove that no matter who you are, you can make a difference in this world.” If you wish to engage more in VP’s full-year school events and fundraising initiatives to witness how your small actions can make a big difference, join and volunteer at VP Oxfam.
