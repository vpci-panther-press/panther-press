Shoot. Pass. Score! Have you heard about Victoria Park’s recent sporting successes and wondered what was going on? Want to support your VP sports teams but don’t know where to start? This athletics recap will brief you on everything you need to know about VP’s Fall 2023 sports season.

## Nothing But Net

### Girls’ Basketball

This past month has been a busy one for the varsity girls’ basketball team. Recently, they’ve played several other schools in the North Region, including AY Jackson, Earl Haig, Sir John A MacDonald, and Lawrence Park. Highlights include a firm 45-27 victory over Earl Haig and a tight game against MacDonald where Vic Park came back from a 12-point deficit to nearly draw it even with 48-45. Up next, VPCI is expected to play Don Mills CI, Newtonbrook SS, and George S Henry Academy, completing a round of games against each team in their division.

## Setting Up For Success

### Boys’ Volleyball

So far, the boys’ volleyball team has played three games, facing off against each team in the East Division: AY Jackson, George Vanier, and George S Henry. Their first game against Vanier ended in a decisive 25-10, 25-20 victory, while the match against AYJ ended in a 25-19, 25-12 loss. Afterwards, a close game against George S Henry ended 26-24, 25-21 in favour of Victoria Park. This puts VPCI at second place in the STO Conference East Division, just behind AYJ. Up next, they’ll play a rematch against each of the teams in their division as they continue to fight for a spot in the Conference Finals.

## One Foot in Front of the Other

### Cross Country 

This year, cross country had a great turnout, with 46 runners across the novice, junior, and senior divisions competing for VPCI. Despite running 4, 5, or 6 kilometres twice a week at practices, our runners had a spring in their step as they raced at Regionals. After two mini-meets, they were well-prepared for the trials of steep hills, chilly weather, and breathtaking cramps at their first real competition. Coming out of the competition, we had the novice girls and boys, junior girls, and select senior girls make it to City Finals. Stay tuned as these determined long-distance athletes vie to qualify for OFSAA!

## Kickin’ It

### Boys’ Soccer

After a less-than-stellar season last year, the varsity boys’ soccer team is off to a good start. They began their season with a 4-1 win against John Polanyi CI, thanks to one player scoring a hat trick. Afterwards, they sustained a loss against William Lyon Mackenzie CI, then won 4-3 against CW Jefferys CI. Then, they tied 1-1 against Downsview CI. This places them at a solid second out of the seven teams in the North Region. The boys’ soccer team will seek to maintain this ranking as they face off against Westview Centennial SS and Emery CI in the coming weeks.

## Lucky 7s

### Rugby 7s

This year, it’s been another strong rugby season for Victoria Park. After just a few weeks of intensive training, our varsity girls’, senior boys’, and junior boys’ teams set out to capture spots at city finals. The senior boys, endowed with some home-field luck, won three of four games at their city final qualifiers. They didn’t place at the top of their bracket, but were able to play in a repechage to compete for a spot at cities. Their season finally ended with a 7-0 loss against W. L. Mackenzie after they won their first repechage round against East York. Following this, the junior boys played their city championship qualifiers; despite their best efforts, they didn’t qualify for the next round of the tournament. Meanwhile, the girls’ team, which includes several of the junior girls who won city championships last year, qualified for cities after a 33-5 win over Northview and a tie with Earl Haig.

## Upcoming Events

So, what’s next on the roster? Swimming tryouts just went by, so suit up to watch the team make waves in the coming season. Mr. Ho, coach of the badminton team, is also transitioning from hosting badminton drop-ins to organizing a competitive team.

This winter, we’ll also see boys’ basketball, girls’ volleyball, and indoor soccer. If you’re interested in trying out, join the VPAC Google Classroom to stay up-to-date.
