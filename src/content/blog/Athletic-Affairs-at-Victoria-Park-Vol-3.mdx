Amidst the storm of exams, holidays, and events, VPCI athletes have been going strong. From the basketball court to the swimming pool, these determined students have been dedicating their early mornings and afternoons to improving their form, skill, and teamwork. Their persistence has garnered them great results thus far in mini meets, games, and various competitions which will ultimately lead to city or provincial finals.

First, the girls’ volleyball teams have already played the majority of their season’s games. The juniors are tied for second place in the East Division by points, having racked up three wins and two losses. Early on in the season, they suffered losses to Don Mills and George S Henry, but the girls quickly found their footing. They triumphed 2-1 in games against Westview Centennial, Downsview, and George Vanier, all in the span of a single week. They only require one more win to secure their place in the next round of competition.

Meanwhile, the senior volleyball players have been just as busy. Much like the juniors, the senior girls began as underdogs when the season commenced in November. After losing 2-0 to AY Jackson and losing sets to Don Mills and Newtonbrook, they came back stronger. At their first home game of the season, they played George S Henry and came out on top. With the home advantage, they continued on to rematch Newtonbrook and AY Jackson, winning both games in two sets.

Next, the boys’ basketball teams are halfway through their seasons. The junior boys have played three games so far, starting with a 65-35 loss against Sir John A Macdonald. Their second game resulted in a 48-23 loss to AY Jackson. In their most recent match, they came out victorious with 56 points to George Vanier’s 40. The senior boys have had similar experiences on the court, with three games under their belt so far. They experienced losses to Sir John A Macdonald, AY Jackson, and George Vanier. Up next, the team is slated to play York Mills.

Beyond the gym, VPCI’s swim team has been training diligently, braving early morning practices and cold showers. So far, they have participated in mini meets with several local schools, including Westview Centennial, Northview, and Lawrence Park. Our swimmers have been performing well in these informal competitions, and are optimistic as they prepare for regionals. The aim is to make a return to OFSAA, which several swim team members attended in 2023.

In other news, the badminton and indoor cricket teams have been busy training as they prepare for further games and tournaments. Overall, it’s shaping up to be a great season. We wish all VPCI athletes the best of luck in their competitive endeavours. _Go Panthers!_
