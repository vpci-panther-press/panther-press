## Introduction

Toronto, Canada, is a vibrant and culturally diverse city that is home to several prestigious universities and colleges. The educational landscape in Toronto offers a wide range of academic programs, but three majors stand out as the favorites among students due to various reasons. It’s high time to understand exactly what makes these post-secondary paths so popular along with the types of students who choose them and the benefits associated with each field.

This attribute makes it a natural choice for students interested in careers in finance, marketing, entrepreneurship, and management. The city's robust economy offers numerous job prospects and its multicultural environment fosters global networking opportunities, which are invaluable for international business students (City of Toronto, n.d.).
