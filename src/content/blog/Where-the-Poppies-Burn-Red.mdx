	  # Where the Poppies Burn Red
    
    Where the poppies burn red in fields of green
    
    Lies the body of young

      Lies the body of young Byrne, just barely eighteen

    A hero, a soldier, a casualty, a brother

    A villain, an enemy, or the son of a mother?
    <br/>

    Banners fly, deep crimson and pearly white

    Reminiscent of bombs and guns alight

    What worth is a war with no winners?

    Which of us heroes? Which of us sinners?

    The mothers of boys, past borders and belief

    Divided by war, united by grief
    <br/>

    The day of his departure, the heavens wept with sorrow

    With no guarantee of a brighter tomorrow

    He bid his farewells with promise of return

    A hug, a kiss, an expression to discern.

    Deception and lies, vows falsely made

    Why did Byrne don one final charade?
    <br/>

    He watched as his comrades bled and withered away

    Their bodies charred black and left to decay

    So why did they fight, day after day?

    For they had families to live for

    And a country to die for.
