  The Palestine and Israel Conflict

By Zahraa Jahangir and Mariam Hussain

</Centered>

The war between Palestine and Israel has been ongoing since 1948 with escalating tensions and never ending battles restricting both peace and freedom. In wars, it always seems as if those physically living within the war zone are affected the most - they are the ones suffering the brutality of violence and bloodshed. However conflicts like the ongoing one between Russia and Ukraine, the fights in Sudan, the lack of basic human rights in underdeveloped countries and of course, the war between Palestine and Israel bring to our attention the disunity of our world right at this moment. We have become disbanded like fragments scattered across the ocean with no one to piece them together.

Neither can we help ourselves, nor each other.

The pain suffered by any human being at any corner of the globe is reverberated and is felt by all of us. The impact of wars and conflicts is a long-lasting one because the trauma is carried through generations and the only way we can heal is if we support each other. We are sure everyone at VP is disheartened by the persecution and oppression taking place around the world and we are proud that VP students are taking the initiative in helping us heal.

VPCI Middle Eastern North African Association (VP MENAA) and VPCI’s Muslim Student Association (VPCI MSA) hosted a Student Palestine Healing Circle on November 8 supervised by a TDSB counselor, providing a safe space for Muslim students to share their stories, experiences, and feelings about the ongoing war. Participating in these spaces has numerous benefits in terms of expressing emotions and being united whilst supporting each other to persevere through trying times.

VP MENAA has also organized VP’s first Soccer World Cup on November 15-16 with students representing the teams: Turkiye, Albania, Sri Lanka, UAE, Tajikistan, Lebanon, Cuba, and Russia. After two days of passionate footwork, Turkiye won the cup and all of the proceeds were donated to Palestine to provide humanitarian aid to Gaza. It is actions like these that bring students together and demonstrate our VP spirit where every goal struck at the net, every voice that gets raised, and every person with a drive unite to achieve a common goal.

With November being intrinsic with the memory of all the fallen martyrs, we are constantly reminded that wars and battles have never brought any good and have only left negative repercussions. As we continue our lives as the leaders of tomorrow, it is imperative that youth take a stand against violence and advocate to protect humanity and protect our unity.
