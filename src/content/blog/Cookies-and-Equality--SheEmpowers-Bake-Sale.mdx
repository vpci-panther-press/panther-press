title: Cookies and Equality – SheEmpowers’ Bake Sale
---

Nov 7 & 8 – In the spirit of fostering unity and promoting gender equality, VP’s club: SheEmpowers, organised a bake sale that served not only a delicious craving but also a greater purpose to promote their values and mission. Today, we chatted with SheEmpower’s President Khaviyaa Suthaharan to delve deeper into the inspiration that went behind the bake sale and how it managed to invite the participation of the school community.

**Cora Tian: Please tell us more about the upcoming bake sale. What inspired the idea?**

Khaviyaa Suthaharan: SheEmpowers decided to do this bake sale as a way to encourage community-building, put our club out there to the school, and connect with like-minded people who have the values of women empowerment and gender equality.

**CT: What delicious treats can we expect to find at the bake sale? Are there any unique recipes that the club is excited to showcase?**

KS: At the bake sale, we will be selling exclusively homemade cookies. These are all baked with love from our executives and volunteers, and that’s what makes them special!

**CT: Beyond the bake sale, what are the mission and values of SheEmpowers? How will the club’s future plans create an equal community at VicPark?**

ST: Although SheEmpowers does focus on female empowerment, it’s more about gender equality. We want to create a safe space to talk about these issues and we know there is a lot of stigma surrounding them. So, we want to make sure that everyone has a voice for what they want to say.

The bake sale ended with great success as all cookies sold out! SheEmpowers opened up VP’s month of November with the mission of promoting inclusivity and awareness of gender equality – the mission the team of SheEmpowers will continue to promote in their future activities.
