title: The Importance of Exercise
---

Navigating through the hectic, busy life of a highschool student is hard. The never-ending mounds of homework, frustrating group projects, and heavy extra-curriculars can be detrimental for your physical and mental health, and be completely overwhelming at times. Finding an outlet for this stress is important, especially when you’re finding yourself under a lot of pressure. An evening bike around your neighborhood, a relaxing walk, or even hitting the gym can help elevate your mood and relieve stress, and regular physical exercise will bring numerous long-term mental and physical benefits.

A key benefit of exercise is increased happiness. When you exercise, your body releases a neurotransmitter called dopamine, or the “happy hormone.” Dopamine is released whenever you do something enjoyable— for example, hanging out with your friends. By exercising, you reward yourself with a rush of dopamine, and your mood is considerably lifted. Feelings of anxiety or stress are lightened, and after consistent bouts of activity, you may also feel a sense of accomplishment and pride. Exercise has a significantly positive impact on one’s mental health, and is a good way to lessen negative feelings.

Furthermore, physical activity is beneficial for your health. Activities like lifting weights, playing volleyball, and jogging will increase bone density, lessening the possibility of future osteoporosis. Regular physical activity can lower numerous health risks, including cardiovascular disease, the development of type 2 diabetes, and several common cancers. Moreover, constant exercise allows you to stay fit and control your weight.

Physical activity is essential for maintaining one’s health and well-being, and should be incorporated in daily life as much as possible. However, entering the world of fitness can be a daunting task, especially when faced with the numerous ways to maintain physical activity. This month, if you’re looking to “push up” your way through the fitness world, look no further than Protein Club! Protein club offers a friendly, judgement-free community where you can begin your fitness journey, and forge a path that leads to the best version of you. Meet Shairah Hasan, an executive member of Protein Club.

Gloria Chen: What is something unique that your club offers to its members? How will this enrich participants’ experience?

Shairah Hasan: Our club has 3 available fitness trainers during each meeting for those who need a little extra help or have any questions about their fitness journey. This is important because working out, if done without care or correct form, can really injure your body. It can also be really nerve wracking to walk into the weight room alone with no plan of what you’re doing. Our trainers are always there to help with anything!

GC: How does a protein club meeting typically go?

SH: Members begin by signing in at the door for attendance, dropping their bags off on the shelves, and then they can start working out!

GC: Are there any exciting plans for future meetings?

SH: We have many small events and competitions that will hopefully be released in detail soon!

GC: Is there anything else you would like to say?

SH: We really hope you consider joining VP Protein, or even drop by for a little while! We are always open to new members.
