name: Ayaa Al-Sultany
bio: >-
  As soon as she opened her eyes, Ayaa Al-Sultany knew she was destined to
  become a writer. Consuming whatever media the world had to offer, hunger never
  ceasing as she basks in the realm of fiction. She put her pen to her paper and
  wrote word after word day and night. She is a cog in the machine of stories,
  pumping out masterful pieces.
